# mqtt-print
Prints messages from an MQTT topic to an attached ESC/POS printer

This project connects to an MQTT broker and subscribes to a topic. Any messages sent to that topic are printed on an attached ESC/POS receipt printer. Think of it as a modern telegram, or steampunk texting. It serves no useful purpose other than being bizarre.
